# Maternal Gut Microbiota Reflecting Poor Diet Quality Predicts Spontaneous Preterm Birth in a Prospective Cohort Study 

## Introduction
A processed, Western diet, high in fat and low in fiber is associated with differences in the gut microbiota and adverse health outcomes in humans; however, little is known about the diet-microbiota relationship and its impact on pregnancy. Spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB), a pregnancy outcome with serious short-and long-term consequences, occurs more frequently in Black and in obese women in the U.S. 
\
In a prospective, case-control sample matched for race and obesity (cases=16, controls=32), we compared the fecal gut microbiota, fecal and plasma metabolites, and diet in the late second trimester. We hypothesized that a Western diet would be associated with reduced microbiota richness and a metabolic signature predicting incidence of SPTB. 
\
The fecal microbiota was characterized by 16S-tagged sequencing and untargeted metabolomics was used to analyze both plasma and fecal metabolites. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for the comparison of microbiota genera, Î±-diversity, fecal and plasma metabolites, and dietary variables between term and SPTB. Beta-diversity was analyzed using PERMANOVA, and metabolite associations were assessed by module analysis.

## Software
- The stool samples were assayed for gut microbial identity using 16S tagged gene sequencing processed by QIIME2, including de-multiplexing, quality control, OUT identification, and taxonomic assignment.
- All statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.5.1. The QIIME2 output was imported into R via R package qiime2R. The stool metabolomics module analysis was implemented using R package WGCNA with compatible R version.

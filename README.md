# Maternal Gut Microbiota Reflecting Poor Diet Quality Predicts Spontaneous Preterm Birth in a Prospective Cohort Study 
A processed, Western diet, high in fat and low in fiber is associated with differences in the gut microbiota and adverse health outcomes in humans; however, little is known about the diet-microbiota relationship and its impact on pregnancy. Spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB), a pregnancy outcome with serious short-and long-term consequences, occurs more frequently in Black and in obese women in the U.S. 
\
In a prospective, case-control sample matched for race and obesity (cases=16, controls=32), we compared the fecal gut microbiota, fecal and plasma metabolites, and diet in the late second trimester. We hypothesized that a Western diet would be associated with reduced microbiota richness and a metabolic signature predicting incidence of SPTB. 
\
The fecal microbiota was characterized by 16S-tagged sequencing and untargeted metabolomics was used to analyze both plasma and fecal metabolites. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for the comparison of microbiota genera, Î±-diversity, fecal and plasma metabolites, and dietary variables between term and SPTB. Beta-diversity was analyzed using PERMANOVA, and metabolite associations were assessed by module analysis.
